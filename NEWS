DEPENDENCY CHANGE
* Remove `catchr` dependency to avoid issues on CRAN

BUG FIXES

* If `var` is omitted from `plot.lmeresamp()` a halfeye plot with all terms is created.

0.2.0

* The case, parametric, and residual bootstraps now suppport `glmerMod` objects.
* The Wild bootstrap is available for `lme` and `lmerMod` objects.
* The CGR bootstrap is now the default "residual" bootstrap algorithm.
* Objects returned by the `bootstrap()` call are now of class `lmeresamp`.
* `lmeresamp` objects have a new structure, including a new `stats` dataframe (contains the observed value, bootstrap mean, standard error, and bias of each LME model parameter).
* New generic `print()` function that is compatible with `lmeresamp` objects
* New generic `confint()` function that is compatible with `lmeresamp` objects (the possible confidence intervals include: basic, normal, percentile, or all)
* A package vignette is now available
* Vignette outlines how to perform parallelization in `bootstrap()` using the `doParallel` and `foreach` packages
* New `combine()` function that combines processes split for parallelization for unified output
